Core Concept

A collaborative platform where players shape AI-generated narratives through group decision-making. Each choice meaningfully impacts the story's progression, with the AI adapting dynamically to the group's decisions.

Stories are designed to reach a satisfying conclusion within a predetermined number of story beats, ensuring narrative cohesion and engagement.
